    <p>Personal development reflection notes - HTML, CSS and JavaScript </p>

    <h2>Module 4 08/12/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> This session returned to the use of GitHub and workflows. The session also covered a task to create a page wth a logo, nav and hero section. There were a few complications during the development of this solution which I will need to review in detail
        as it covered styling and CSS. During the last 15 minutes, my connection had issues with audio. I watched the recording the next day and there appeared to be a takeaway task which I wasn't sure what I need to do. I decided to leave the task as
        it was focused on command line git. I need to focus on the syntax in JS, HTML and CSS. I need to find time to work on these areas especially styling. Once the course is complete and I have more time I plan to use FreeCodeCamp until it becomes
        second nature. An area that I plan to review in detail is the use of BootStrap and the various frameworks</p>

    <h2>Module 4 01-03/12/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> Due to last minute issues I missed these sessions. This did not cause any problem as I was able to review the recordings and slides at my own pace which enabled to me experiment with my learning. The first session returned to the use of GitHub and
        covered the difference between static and dynamic sites. The session also provided an insight into the use of CMSs and GitHubPages. The second session covered the use of PseudoCode to plan the structure of your solutions. I have a good understanding
        of these areas. The areas I need to focus on are the syntax in JS, HTML and CSS. I need to find time to work on these areas especially styling. Once the course is complete and I have more time I will use FreeCodeCamp and review these sessions
        until it becomes second nature. An area that I plan to have a detailed look into is the use of BootStrap and the various frameworks</p>

    <h2>Module 3 26/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. The session focused on the providing an animal image filtering solution, which used techniques to access and style the disply. I need to review the syntax in the JS, HTML and CSS as the filter did not work. The other
        functionality and styling appeared to be okay. I did not have time to use FreeCodeCamp before this session, which seemed to slow my progress. I need more practise in this area. I need more practise with the syntax. Luke's gitHub https://github.com/pixel2code/LTU-Reboot-Digital-Coding/tree/Cohort-6
    </p>

    <h2>Module 3 24/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. The session focused on the DOM and how to access, query and manipulate the DOM. I did not have time to use FreeCodeCamp before this session, which seemed to slow my progress. I need more practise in this area. I need
        more practise with the syntax.
    </p>

    <h2>Module 3 19/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. The session covered developing more practical solutions including versions of a Shopping Cart and applying discount codes. The solutuions required use of the techniques gained such as loops, arrays, functions, objects
        and methods. Tried various examples to experiment as well as using Luke's version. I need to learn the keywords as I am worried about using a keyword as a variable. Did not have time to use FreeCodeCamp since the last session. Using these sessions
        to supplement the learning and explore the syntax. The areas I need to work on is the syntax and styling to use of the available display area in different devices (e.g. desktop, mobile, tablet, etc).
    </p>

    <h2>Module 3 17/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. Lost connecion for approx. 20 minutes into the session for 15 minutes. Need to review the missed area as Luke demonstrated styling of JavaScript. The session covered developing more practical solutions (Times tables,
        favourite foods, recipes) and using the techniques gained such as loops, arrays, functions, objects and methods. Tried various examples. I need to learn the keywords as I am worried about using a keyword as a variable. As recommended, using FreeCodeCamp
        between lessons which is excellent. Using these sessions to supplement the learning so using the sessions to try new examples and explore the syntax. The area I need to work on is remebering the syntax. As mentiioned by Luke and Alex this is not
        an issue as Google as the answers such as W3Schools. Just need to practise. Found VSCode Shortcut Sheet to indetify auto formatiing option to save time coding. The area I need to work on most is understanding and practising formatting and the
        use of the available display area in different devices (e.g. desktop, mobile, tablet, etc).
    </p>

    <h2>Module 3 12/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. This session commenced with Luke's solution for the previous feature. This session covered developing practical solutions (Percentage Calculator, use of Switch for drinks machine and a calculator) using the techniques
        gained. Tried various examples. I need to learn the keywords as I am worried about using a keyword as a variable. As recommended, using FreeCodeCamp between lessons which is excellent. Using these sessions to supplement the learning so using the
        sessions to try new examples and explore the syntax. The area I need to work on is remebering the syntax. As mentiioned by Luke and Alex this is not an issue as Google as the answers such as W3Schools. Just need to practise. Found VSCode Shortcut
        Sheet to indetify auto formatiing option to save time coding.

    <h2>Module 3 11/11/20 - Reflection for session 2</h2>
    <p> Second of the JavaScript sessions. I missed these sessions, however, it did not cause any issues as it was easy to watch Luke on the recorded session and puase the video to copy actions. This session commenced with Luke's solution for the Tip feature.
        I copied the solution to test it, but received an error but was able to debug it using the Console Log which Luke had previously demonstarted. The issue was as expected a typo. This session covered functions, local and global variables, boolean,
        control flow, if statements, logical operators. Tried various examples. As recommended, using FreeCodeCamp between lessons which is excellent. Using these sessions to supplement that learning so using the sessions to try new examples and explore
        the syntax. The area I need to work on is remebering the syntax. As mentiioned by Luke and Alex this is not an issue as Google as the answers such as W3Schools. Just need to practise. Found VSCode Shortcut Sheet to indetify auto formatiing option

    <p>In todays session we covered an introduction to the source control tool GitHub and using the IDE VSCode as a text editor. Alex highlighted the importance of version control tools and the benefits of modern text editors. He also provided an overview
        of VSCode extension. Due to issues with my laptop the examples had to be completed after the meeting, but this did not cause any issues. Later Alex displayed the use of GitPages, however, there were issues with this area when I applied it locally.
        Following the introduction of extenstions in VSCode issues/messages were intorduced in VSCode regarding Git rather than GitHub. Questions also arose relating to the branch not appearing in VSCode. Line 11 was reflected in the local version of
        GitHub but not in the browser version This issue was identified as waiting for local commit to Main. Issues still in VSCode with messages regarding Git.smaller-image We previously had an introduction into the course and web concepts. The sessions
        provided an understanding of the internet and client/server technologies. Other areas included identification of devices using DNS servers and IP addresses.smaller-image
