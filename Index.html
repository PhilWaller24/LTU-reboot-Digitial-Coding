    <h2>Module 3 17/11/20 - Reflection for session</h2>
    <p> JavaScript Practical session. This session covered developing more practical solutions (Times tables, favourite foods, recipes) and using the techniques gained such as loops, arrays, functions, objects and methods. Tried various examples. I need to
        learn the keywords as I am worried about using a keyword as a variable. As recommended, using FreeCodeCamp between lessons which is excellent. Using these sessions to supplement the learning so using the sessions to try new examples and explore
        the syntax. The area I need to work on is remebering the syntax. As mentiioned by Luke and Alex this is not an issue as Google as the answers such as W3Schools. Just need to practise. Found VSCode Shortcut Sheet to indetify auto formatiing option
        to save time coding.

        I copied the solution to test it, but received an error but was able to debug it using the Console Log which Luke had previously demonstarted. The issue was as expected a typo. This session covered functions, local and global variables, boolean,
        control flow, if statements, logical operators. Tried various examples. As recommended, using FreeCodeCamp between lessons which is excellent. Using these sessions to supplement that learning so using the sessions to try new examples and explore

        Following the introduction of extenstions in VSCode issues/messages were intorduced in VSCode regarding Git rather than GitHub. Questions also arose relating to the branch not appearing in VSCode. Line 11 was reflected in the local version of
