In todays session we covered an introduction to the source control tool GitHub and using the IDE VSCode as a text editor.
Alex highlighted the importance of version control tools and the benefits of modern text editors.
He also provided an overview of VSCode extensions
Due to issues with my laptop the examples had to be completed after the meeting, but this did not cause any issues.
